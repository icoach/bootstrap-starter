Bootstrap Starter Template
==========================

Things that can be automated, should be automated. When starting a web project, most of the stuff you need at the beginning is the same. This repo should help you quickly set up new Boostrap based project and get you going.

## Features

* Install components with Bower
* Automate tasks with Grunt
* Concatenate, minify and compress JS and CSS

## How to use

It cannot be simpler, just download this repo and start working.

**1) Clone repository**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:icoach/bootstrap-starter.git
```

**2) Install heavy-lifting utilities**

```sh
npm install
```

**3) Install Bootstrap 3 and other libraries**

```sh
bower install
```

**3) Compile the template and Watch for changes in your templates**

Your environment is set up, now you can just start working on your project. To build all assets, use Grunt:

```sh
grunt
```

Grunt can also be used to monitor files and re-build the project on each change. For this we use Grunt's watch task:

```sh
grunt watch
```

Next time you change the file, Grunt will perform all build tasks.
